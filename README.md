# RH_Timesheet_Project
This individual project is designed to get you thinking about data collection and to develop the discipline to collect and analyze data regularly.  Starting of the first class, you will keep a spreadsheet tracking how long you spend working on each course (outside of class).  The spreadsheet should contain five (5) columns:


initials	date	course_id	time(m)	summary
SS	8/24/2023	DS160-01	30	Installed Anaconda Python
SS	8/24/2023	CS311	123	Worked on JavaScript code to implement Quicksort algorithm

If you work on a course at different times throughout the day, enter multiple records. This will be useful for looking at aggregation later on.  Ensure you don't write anything you wouldn't want others to see in your summary.

Create a Git repository named XXX_Timesheet_Project where XXX are your initials.  Submit the link to your repository by January 18th at 10:00 am with your first week's worksheet in this assignment. The worksheet should be in .csv format, not .xslx.  You can copy/paste the link in the area provided. Starting Tuesday August 29rd (and every following Tuesday) by 9:00 am, commit an update to your repository with the last week's additions.  I will write a script to pull them immediately after class automatically.
